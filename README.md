Welcome to the Common Security Module Project!
==============================================

The CBIIT Common Security Module (CSM) provides a comprehensive solution to common security objectives, with flexible delivery of security tools to allow application developers to integrate security with minimal coding effort. This helps eliminate the need for development teams to create their own security methodology. CSM provides solutions for authentication, authorization, and user provisioning.

CSM provides solutions for:

* Authentication to validate and verify a user's credentials. CSM, working with credential providers including Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) and others, confirms that a user exists and the password is valid for that application.
* Authorization to grant or deny access to data, methods, and objects. CSM incorporates an Authorization schema and database so that users can only perform the operations or have access to the data for which they have the needed rights.
* User Provisioning to allow an administrator to create and modify users and their associated access rights.

The web-based CSM User Provisioning Tool (UPT) application can easily be integrated with single or multiple applications and authorization databases. The UPT provides functionality to create, edit, and delete authorization data elements such as Roles, Privileges, Protection Elements, Users and Groups, and also provides functionality to associate them with each other. The runtime API can then use this authorization data to authorize user actions.
